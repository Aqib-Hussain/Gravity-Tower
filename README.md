# Gravity-Tower
Gravity tower is a 2D platformer created in Java using my universities game engine which is based off of box2D.  In the game you play as a wizard who cannot only just fire fireballs but control gravity itself, gravity of himself and his foes.

The repository contains the entirety of the project including all documentation.
